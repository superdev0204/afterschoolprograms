Together We Can and Reverend Father Ronald Tosti of Christ the King Parish, both of Mashpee, began planning to create a safe and nurturing environment for Cape youth. A call was made to Joseph MacDonald of the Boys & Girls Club of America. The public and concerned citizens were notified by newspapers and word of mouth that a meeting was planned. A steering committee was formed and chaired by Fire Chief George Baker. That group formed various committees and over the next few months, all involved worked towards incorporating as a non-profit tax exempt entity. With the help of Attorney Robert Mills, we were incorporated on April 27, 1995. Members and officers were elected and we were finally on the road to establishing the Boys & Girls Club of Cape Cod. Later that summer, non-profit status was granted. We participated in various events to being to spread the word about building-based programs that could make a real difference for the youth of Cape Cod. We held small fund-raisers and dances, entered a float in the Falmouth Christmas Parade, and took 3rd place in the Children's Float category. Today we stand strong with a Board of Directors of 18 members, representing a wide spectrum of community interests and professions. We have money and pledges and a long list of volunteers that worked hard to achieve our dream of giving the youth of Cape Cod a Boys & Girls Club of their own.

(LEAP) is an after-school program on the campus of the Lincoln School in Lincoln, Mass., where students can play outside, do their homework, go on field trips, work on creative projects, and just hang out in a group setting under the supervision of a professional staff. LEAP was established in 1981 by a group of Lincoln parents who needed safe and dependable after-school care for their children. The program began in a single room with a part-time director and a handful of students. Today, LEAP has dedicated space in Hartwell Pod C with full-time directors and more than a dozen full-time and part-time staff members, and the program serves more than 100 children. LEAP is open every weekday from school dismissal until 6 p.m. for children in kindergarten through eighth grade when school is in session. Staff members from LEAP walk children who are in grades K-5 in a group from the Smith building to LEAP, which is located in Hartwell pod C across the ballfield. Older children may walk to LEAP by themselves. LEAP’s on-campus location allows the program to take full advantage of the Lincoln School playgrounds and athletic fields. Children are escorted to any activity that takes place on campus, including Recreation Department activities, sports, music lessons, play rehearsals, Scout meetings, and language classes.";;"Kindergarten: 5 days a week $680, 4 days a week $592, 3 days a week (including Wednesday) $567, 3 days a week (without Wednesday) $453, 2 days a week (including Wednesday) $412, 2 days a week (without Wednesday) $299; Grades 1-8: 5 days a week $577, 4 days a week $500, 3 days a week (including Wednesday) $479, 3 days a week (without Wednesday) $381, 2 days a week (including Wednesday) $350, 2 days a week (without Wednesday) $258; Annual $100 nonrefundable registration fee that covers LEAP’s per-child cost for insurance, $50 before July 15";"YES";"NO";"https://lincolnleap.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cropped-leap-heading.jpg";

Our older brochures and websites might say that we are a multicultural, anti-bias, and social justice minded program. Given that we’ve heard these words used and abused so often to serve various agendas, we’re going to describe our mission without using them. Our interest is in creating a comfortable space where people are welcomed and valued without being reduced to food, clothing, music, etc. As important as these things are to cultures, we know that people are so much more. After all, we are people too and know there is more based on our own experiences. We want to plant the seeds of good critical thinking and conflict resolution skills in natural, kid friendly settings. We plant the seeds during discussion times and offer room to practice during the students’ activity choice times. For example, we have noticed that past students seem more open to difference during formal discussions than they practice out on the playground. The comments they let slip about who “throws like a girl” or what’s “so gay” offer us opportunities to ask “What do you mean?” or “Why is that an insult?” It’s not about pushing a “We don’t say that” propaganda but about finding our assumptions, questioning our assumptions, and considering some revisions that might improve our interactive experiences. So that’s us, attempting to make your little people more awesome one tag game at a time.";"Homework, Arts and Crafts, Music, Dance, Sports, Discussion Meetings, Science Experiments, Indoor and Outdoor Free-Play";"$260/month Full-time Enrollment; $54/month per Individual Day; $15/day Additional Day; Vouchers Accepted; Pay 40% with Free or Reduced Lunch";"YES";"NO";"http://capacidadprograms.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/capacidadlogo.jpg";
