With its own separate ten-member staff and well-equipped facility, ASP offers a cheerful environment where children can participate in a variety of creative projects and indoor and outdoor play. Families who desire a longer day for their children may elect, at additional cost, to stay up until 6 p.m. every day or for a few days each week. Time at our After-School Program is an appropriate balance of supervised free play, quiet time for reading and homework, and structured activities in which children can explore their own interests and develop friendships. Children who stay at ASP between 3 - 4:30 p.m. enjoy a variety of ""clubs,"" creative activities that rotate every four weeks. Cooking, jewelry making, drama, sewing, clay, and arts and crafts are among the favorite choices. Upper Division students can participate in an optional Tuesday After-School Program that includes time for games, activities, and (weather permitting) outside play as well as a study hall. From 2 - 4:30 p.m. the students will be in the main building, and at 4:30, they will join the younger students at the ASP building. ";;;"YES";"NO";;

You’re likely already dreaming of what you want to be when you grow up. At YMCA Camp Letts, we believe that each summer opens a new window of possibility. When the paved driveway turns to gravel, you’ll know that you’ve entered a world all your own. You may feel a little nervous when your parents drop you off, but we guarantee you’ll never want to leave. You will sail, soar or saunter your way to each and every adventure. You’ll meet the best friends of your life in the most unexpected places. You get to unplug from the agonies of adolescence to spend your days on our woodsy waterfront. You’ll meet our caring counselors from over 20 countries, learning wacky games, customs and accents. You can wear your camp spirit proudly in the Dining Hall as you compete with your cabinmates for the coveted Crew Cup. Every visit and camper’s experience is different. Our staff love what they do - and it shows. That’s why they designed every moment of the day to help campers build independence, self-esteem, social skills, physical health and an awareness of their gifts to the world.

We run our classrooms based on a primary care principal: the same lead teacher is in charge of each age-designated classroom each day to create stability and set positive expectations for the children in their care. Our instructors are experienced and CPR and First Aid certified. We provide a quiet environment for homework and areas for fun activities to keep kids engaged when the work is done. We even have time at the end of the day to play dodgeball, tag, and other gross-motor games in our large activity area. There’s something to keep everyone busy and happy.
