High School Extended Learning: High schools across the county are struggling to properly prepare students for college and the workforce.  We believe it is imperative for communities to partner with schools to provide additional supports. Using evidence-based practices, the THINK Together for Teens (T3) high school program is designed to respond to the unique needs and strengths identified by students, teachers and administrators. Our overall goal is to support college and career-ready students by helping them meet state standards in core academic subjects, meet all graduation requirements, and expose them to relevant 21st Century Learning Skills.  Although the activities schedule varies by school, all T3 programs incorporate academic and enrichment components, a nutritional snack and opportunities for traditional and non-traditional physical activities including intramural sports and dance, and utilize school fitness centers and weightlifting facilities. THINK Together forged a new partnership in 2010-11 with the j.k. livin foundation. The foundation, started by actor Matthew McConaughey and his life partner Camila Alves, is helping to expand THINK Together’s wellness and fitness curriculum in its high school programs.

High School Extended Learning: High schools across the county are struggling to properly prepare students for college and the workforce.  We believe it is imperative for communities to partner with schools to provide additional supports. Using evidence-based practices, the THINK Together for Teens (T3) high school program is designed to respond to the unique needs and strengths identified by students, teachers and administrators. Our overall goal is to support college and career-ready students by helping them meet state standards in core academic subjects, meet all graduation requirements, and expose them to relevant 21st Century Learning Skills.  Although the activities schedule varies by school, all T3 programs incorporate academic and enrichment components, a nutritional snack and opportunities for traditional and non-traditional physical activities including intramural sports and dance, and utilize school fitness centers and weightlifting facilities. THINK Together forged a new partnership in 2010-11 with the j.k. livin foundation. The foundation, started by actor Matthew McConaughey and his life partner Camila Alves, is helping to expand THINK Together’s wellness and fitness curriculum in its high school programs. Students enrolled in the THINK Together high school program are six times more likely to graduate from high school than their peers. Our high school programs are voluntary and consistently draw more than 120 students daily.";"Academics: Homework Center, Tutoring, CAHSEE Preparation Classes, College Readiness Workshops, Credit Recovery Classes; Enrichment; Wellness ";;"YES";"NO";"http://www.thinktogether.org/wp-content/themes/u-design5.2/styles/new_page-images/logo.png";

Students receive a healthy snack before participating in a rotation of structured activities. THINK Together’s standards-based curriculum intentionally aligns with core day instruction and extends learning time in a safe, adult-supervised environment.  The enrichment component helps students close the achievement gap with a broad array of disguised learning activities driven by student interest and staff talents. Examples include journalism, cheerleading, science fair preparation, skateboarding, cooking, crafts, robotics, and graphic design.  The development of 21st Century Learning Skills, such as critical thinking, problem solving through inquiry, creativity, entrepreneurial skills, communication, collaboration, social responsibility and leadership is embedded within project-based learning activities in our programs. A typical THINK Together elementary school site serves between 90 and 200 students each school day. Each site is staffed by Program Leaders in order to maintain a student to paid staff ratio of no more than 20:1. Program Leaders work alongside community volunteers and are supervised by one full-time Site Coordinator, who works closely with the school principal and teachers to align the content of the afterschool program with school-day needs and priorities.

Elementary Extended Learning: THINK Together’s daily comprehensive elementary school programs consist of academic and enrichment elements and a healthy living component that includes physical fitness, character education and nutrition education. The program is open to Kindergarten through 6th grade students from the time the school day ends to 6 pm (approximately 20-22 hours a week). Students receive a healthy snack before participating in a rotation of structured activities. THINK Together’s standards-based curriculum intentionally aligns with core day instruction and extends learning time in a safe, adult-supervised environment.  The enrichment component helps students close the achievement gap with a broad array of disguised learning activities driven by student interest and staff talents. Examples include journalism, cheerleading, science fair preparation, skateboarding, cooking, crafts, robotics, and graphic design.  The development of 21st Century Learning Skills, such as critical thinking, problem solving through inquiry, creativity, entrepreneurial skills, communication, collaboration, social responsibility and leadership is embedded within project-based learning activities in our programs.
