Many, however, enjoy the gymnasium, a high action space that allows members to run off their energy. A place they come together as a team through sportsmanship, communication and in developing skills of greatness through character and integrity. Last, but not least, is the teen room, a place where great futures start and success stories begin, a space that gives older kids the opportunity to become young leaders and mentors for the next generation.";"Character and Leadership Development; Health and Life Skills; Education and Career Development; Sports, Fitness and Recreation;The Arts";;"YES";"NO";"http://www.bgcppr.org/sites/default/files/bgc-logo-125years4_0.png";

In the computer lab, members play games; learn how to use the internet and Microsoft Office to be successful in school. Members express their creativity in the art room, where they are free to create and enjoy their art without judgment. They run off their energy in the gymnasium where they learn to play various sports. They are able to breathe in the fresh air outside with their large enclosed playing field. Members enjoy the playground, basketball court, baseball field and a grassy open area. However, it is through programs that the true magic of the club can be seen. Triple Play, S.M.A.R.T Girls, Passport to Manhood, and Drama are a few of the programs that the club has to offer. Through programming members learn about friends, respect, bullying, peer pressure, and thinking outside the box in order to explore a part of them that has yet to be discovered.";"Character and Leadership Development; Health and Life Skills; Education and Career Development; Sports, Fitness and Recreation;The Arts";;"YES";"NO";"http://www.bgcppr.org/sites/default/files/bgc-logo-125years4_0.png";

The program was created in 1991 through a collaboration involving community representatives and faculty members at DU. Program activities at the Bridge Project aim to reduce educational barriers and improve academic and behavioral outcomes for children residing in five Denver public housing communities. By being located within the public housing neighborhoods, the Bridge Project removes the issue of transportation many children and families face on a daily basis. The Bridge Project has had a consistent presence in the neighborhoods for 25 years, enabling staff and volunteers to build strong relationships. Bridge is known throughout the public housing communities as  a safe space for youth to learn and grow throughout the year. Finally, Bridge has committed to having credentialed educators and social workers at each site to provide the best level of education and support to the children attending each day. The Columbine Bridge Project site was created in 1998 out of a clear need to provide a safe space for its children. No recreation centers exist within a mile of this public housing community, making Bridge one of the only places for its 50+ participants to go after school and during the summer months. The support of the Columbine community, which includes a Community Advisory Board, has helped countless children grow into successful and self-sufficient adults. Former Site Director Sergio Colmenero says, “We have the most awesome community, staff, and kids.”";"Afterschool Program: homework hel,  tutoring, reading, classes, snacks; Summer Program: tutoring, reading, classes, field trips, snacks; Scholarship Program";;"YES";"NO";"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/554918a3e4b0955eaa872045/t/55491936e4b0393fe160f04d/1456789161834/?format=400w";

The program was created in 1991 through a collaboration involving community representatives and faculty members at DU. Program activities at the Bridge Project aim to reduce educational barriers and improve academic and behavioral outcomes for children residing in five Denver public housing communities. By being located within the public housing neighborhoods, the Bridge Project removes the issue of transportation many children and families face on a daily basis. The Bridge Project has had a consistent presence in the neighborhoods for 25 years, enabling staff and volunteers to build strong relationships. Bridge is known throughout the public housing communities as  a safe space for youth to learn and grow throughout the year. Finally, Bridge has committed to having credentialed educators and social workers at each site to provide the best level of education and support to the children attending each day. The Lincoln Park site is located in the historic Neighorhood House giving it the opportunity to serve both the North Lincoln and South Lincoln public housing neighborhoods. During the 2014-2015 academic year, the Lincoln Park site registered 140 kindergarten through high school students and served an average of 75 children every day. The Site Director, Educator, and Admin, have a combined 40 years of service with the Bridge Project!";"Afterschool Program: homework hel,  tutoring, reading, classes, snacks; Summer Program: tutoring, reading, classes, field trips, snacks; Scholarship Program";;"YES";"NO";"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/554918a3e4b0955eaa872045/t/55491936e4b0393fe160f04d/1456789161834/?format=400w";
