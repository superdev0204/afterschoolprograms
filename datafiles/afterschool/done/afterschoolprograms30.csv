The Union League Boys & Girls Clubs strives to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring citizens. We currently serve more than 13,600 enrolled members between the ages of 6 and 18 at 8 locations.  Each day, more than 1,400 youth take part in programming focused on academic success, healthy lifestyles and good character and citizenship. For 95 years, the Union League Boys & Girls Clubs have served the after-school development needs of at-risk youth in Chicago. The organization also staffs and manages its own 247-acre summer camp in Salem, Wisconsin where youth from Chicago’s inner city participate in enrichment activities in an environment free from drugs, gangs and violence. The Union League Boys & Girls Clubs also launched a programming initiative at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center aimed at reducing the high rate of recidivism among the juvenile detainees. We help youth prepare to reach their full potential.

One of the best features of this program is that it is conveniently located in schools within Districts 41 and 89.

This unique program focuses on the Y’s four core values: caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. Safe ‘n Sound provides priceless help by providing an environment, role models and activities that are conducive to developing these core values.

Parents can go to work with ease knowing their children are safe during those out-of-school hours, and children can enjoy spending the additional time with their peers. One of the best features of this program is that it is conveniently located in schools within Districts 41 and 89. If your child’s school does not have an on-site program, our Y serves as a main location and we provide transportation to and from area elementary schools in Districts 41 and 200. This unique program focuses on the Y’s four core values: caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. Safe ‘n Sound provides priceless help by providing an environment, role models and activities that are conducive to developing these core values.
