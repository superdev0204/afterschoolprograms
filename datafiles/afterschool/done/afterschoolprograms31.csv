Our program for girls in the 3rd through 8th grades inspires girls to be joyful, healthy and confident using a fun, experience-based curriculum which creatively integrates running. The 20-lesson Girls on the Run curriculum combines training for a 5k (3.1 miles) running event with lessons that inspire girls to become independent thinkers, enhance their problem solving skills and make healthy decisions. All of this is accomplished through an active collaboration with girls and their parents, schools, volunteers, staff, and the community.";;;"YES";"NO";"https://girlsontherunstlouis.org/sites/default/files/Logo_0.png";

After a great deal of discussion and prayer, the Westbrooks worked closely with the First Mennonite Church of Morton to establish the B.A.C.E. program. They feel God has given them the ability and the responsibility to open the doors of B.A.C.E. to any family, regardless of their finanical status. The Westbrooks want to use God's resources for God's purpose. Since the inception of B.A.C.E. in 2000, they have seen many children make the life changing decision to give their lives to Christ. Many others have begun to attend local churches in the area. As you can see, B.A.C.E. is so much more than a before and after school program.
