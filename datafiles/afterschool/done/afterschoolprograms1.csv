Many of our children are dependent on single mothers supporting and raising multiple children. Often after school, these children are left to their own supervision while their parents or guardians are working. In this gap of time, the ARDC After School Program provides a safe place for a snack, recreation, Reading Skills improvement, access to the computer lab for Math foundations, daily character building & Bible lessons, and finally, a nutritious dinner at the end of each day. Through the daily time spent with the kids in our After School Program, volunteers can form mentor-like relationships.

Students enter the program in the 8th grade; P.A.R.K.’s role is a 5-year commitment to the students to help ensure graduation from high school, as well as individual growth. Each day, P.A.R.K. provides a safe environment for students to complete academic requirements as well as: Support with homework; Tutoring in all courses; Recreation activities; Leadership development; Involvement in community services. Our after-school program includes both a spiritual and academic element. Before Academic Hour begins, we start the program with the Lord's Prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance. Academic Hour is focused on homework management, tutoring, reading and research assistance in our library and computer lab. Throughout Academic Hour, the students are assisted by Student Life Managers, a Curriculum Coordinator, an Education Outreach Coordinator, Group Leaders and Tutors. At the completion of the first, second and third nine weeks of school, a Skill Builders List is comprised. Students who have more than one ""D"" or an ""F"" on their report card are required to do additional Academic Hour. The after-school program also features weekly Bible study, community service activities, field trips and the opportunity to participate in civic club programs in place at P.A.R.K. The Summer Enrichment Program identifies specific academic goals for students to master. Once students achieve these goals, they are more likely to have higher grades when they return to school. To strengthen skills during the Summer Enrichment and Academic Programs, P.A.R.K. uses an outline assessment and instructional tool, Skills Tutor, which acts as a personal tutor for each student. Skills Tutor diagnoses and identifies gaps in a student’s knowledge, prescribes instruction then tests for mastery of a subject. P.A.R.K. then uses the change in grade point average (GPA) as an indicator of what students have learned. The average GPA is between 1.5 and 2.5 when students enter the program. To monitor students’ progress, P.A.R.K. obtains grade reports issued every nine weeks for each student. Furthermore, students with low grades must bring a weekly grade report from all of their teachers. Finally, P.A.R.K. also uses a more subjective measuring tool; the counselor/parent evaluation. When students enter the P.A.R.K. program, their counselor and parents evaluate them on various criteria: attitude, discipline, self-esteem, etc. Counselor and parents complete this same evaluation at the close of each academic year.";;;YES;NO;http://www.positivekids.org/images/logo.jpg;
