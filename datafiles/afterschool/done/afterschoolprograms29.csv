Heart & Sole creates a positive, structured space for middle school girls to learn about themselves, explore new ideas, cultivate empathy, strengthen connections and develop life skills that will help them as they move through adolescence and beyond. The Heart & Sole curriculum is rich with themes girls can relate to, addressing the whole girl—body, brain, heart, spirit and social connection - and building important life skills such as team building, developing a support system, boundary setting, decision making, asking for and providing help, and more. This 10-week program is accessible to all girls regardless of athletic ability or fitness level and considers the range of ages and varied experiences of middle schoolers. Physical activity includes strength and conditioning appropriate for this age group.

Little Village is the retail, residential and cultural capital of the Mexican community in the Midwest.

While solid housing stock and thriving commercial districts have been key to the community's prosperity, the neighborhood is challenged to invest in its human resources—in particular the youth in the community. Half of the residents are under the age of 25, creating a demand for better support for education, recreation programs and other social services.
