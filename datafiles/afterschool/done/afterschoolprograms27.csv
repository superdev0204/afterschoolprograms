The age divisions within the Club allow for programs to be designed and implemented at a developmentally appropriate level for youth. The Discovery Zone offers all of the traditional Boys and Girls Club programs but modified and geared specifically toward our youngest members.  That means elementary members will receive guidance from paid youth development professionals to help them improve their study skills and grades, learn hw to play cooperatively with other children, increase physical fitness, and enhance computer literacy in our iMac Media Arts Center.  Additionally, members that attend Lunalilo Elementary School are required to participate in the “Crossing Crew” with our staff that ensures students get to the Club under adult supervision to increase safety while crossing the street to the club. The middle school members, or the “preps” as they are called at the Spalding Club, have an opportunity to participate in diverse programs that emphasize the importance of becoming involved in a variety of activities so they can begin to develop their own unique identities as young adolescents.  Preps are encouraged to try programs that: engage their creativity, teach them to include peers of different backgrounds and with different interests, and emphasize the importance of setting personal goals and working to accomplish them. Youth have an opportunity to make friends from other middle schools, get involved in field trips throughout the community and have fun! The teen center is set aside for members who are currently enrolled in high school. The staff and programs aim to help teens set goals for academic success and create a post-graduation plan for career development. Teens have the chance to participate in service learning projects that enable them to become change-makers in their local communities. The teen center is also a great place for teens to socialize and relax together, to enjoy athletic and fitness programs with their peers as teammates and to find positive ways to have fun with their friends in a safe environment with dependable staff and volunteer mentors.";;;"YES";"NO";"http://www.bgch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BGCH-trans-logo1-300x168.png";
