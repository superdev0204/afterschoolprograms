The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development.  Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age. They also develop important strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. We start with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what’s important to them. Then, we look at the importance of team work and healthy relationships. And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health. At the end of each three month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event.  This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum.

It means: Supporting Others and Acting Responsibly. That stands true to the faculty and staff at Tesnatee Gap Elementary. They work hard to build upon the foundation set before them by the faculty and staff of the former White County Intermediate School and continue to strive to build strong relationships with their parents, students, and community members.  Their main focus is to offer engaging and meaningful learning opportunities for all students at TGAP! The 21st Century program continues this philosophy and supports the day program by offering after school Reading, Math, Technology, and enrichment opportunities for the enrolled students.  In addition to a daily snack and a drink, the TGES 21st Century program supports individual student needs through various computer programs, hands on learning projects, teaching methods, and homework help. There is no cost to attend the 21st Century program; however, an application must be submitted and approved before a student may attend. Summer School is also available at no charge. Transportation is provided for both the school year enrollment and the summer school program. The program follows the school calendar and operates Monday thru Thursday, after school until 6:00 p.m.";;"No Fee";"YES";"NO";;

Upon arrival, afterschoolers are served a substantial snack. We choose to serve a heavier snack because students have eaten lunch so much earlier in the day, they are generally very hungry once they arrive at our center. After snack is completed, children begin on homework. We choose to separate the afterschoolers into two groups; Pre-K through 2nd grade and grades 3-6. This allows the older students with more homework to have a longer quiet time without making the younger children who have completed their work wait. Teachers offer help with homework and check their work. However, we always encourage parents to go over homework with their children each night. After homework is completed, students generally work on a fun activity and then go outside (weather permitting). Our afterschool teachers encourage working together to play outdoor, card, and board games. On days the schools are closed and The Treehouse is open, your afterschooler is welcome to attend from 6:30am-6:30pm. We charge an additional $15.00 for these days because we provide breakfast and lunch. We may take a field trip or hold special activities at the center these days which is at no additional cost to you.

Mission: The mission of SafeHaven is to provide a safe and supervised after school education, enrichment and recreation program for elementary school children ages 4 to 12 in Fulton County. Values: 1. Nothing we do is as important as the effect it has on a child. 2. Engaging activities develop values, skills and relationships. Activities are vehicles for creating values, building skills and solidifying peer and adult relationships. An engaging activity holds children’s attention, awakens their imagination, and inspires them to want to learn more. 3. All children have the right to be accepted, respected and valued by others. Children are individuals to be developed, not problems to be solved. 4. Children should be involved in decision-making and program design. If children get to choose how, when, in what and with whom to be engaged, they are far more likely to enjoy themselves and behave cooperatively. 5. When we listen for understanding everyone learns - children and adults alike. We are constantly able to learn from our children as well as each other. Everyone is a learner.

The program meets monday-thursday during the school calander. The focus of the program is to provide assistance with homework, build math and reading skills, and help the students successfully intigrate into the American school system. ​ SACC's after-school currently serves refugee youth who have been in the United States for 3 years or less, and encompasses grade levels kindergarden through fifth grade. In 2009 all the students in the program were refugees from Somalia. Throughout the years the program has expanded to include refugee youth from many different countries. This year the program has served refugee youth from Somalia, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Bhutan, and Nepal, with ages ranging from 7-13. While the programs primary mission is the continued education of the youth, we believe there must be a mixture of phyical activity and learning. We provide structured physical activity once a week, and provide a nutritious snack each day.  ";;;"YES";"NO";;
