Yes, your child will have FUN, Make Friends, and laugh (a lot). But they'll also develop powerful life skills like discipline, focus, confidence, and more. Ancient Martial Arts meets modern fun for one heck of a powerful program! That's what our program is all about. Read on to learn more about what we offer. Martial Arts isn't just ""punches and kicks."" It's lessons on life. We use martial arts training to help your child GROW. We teach kids about goal setting and working hard to reach their dreams. Our partner exercises teach them social skills, team work, and leadership. And the fitness helps them stay healthy and strong. One thing parents love about our program is the level of care we put into it. We even pick up your children from school, by our staff only, in a well marked vehicle. NEVER by a third party. Safe and sound until you pick them up from us. Learning in a safe environment full of motivation is what we're all about! And of course - ""Quiet Down Time"" lets them finish homework, enjoy reading, or even draw a picture if they want! Quiet time is crucial in martial arts to create a steel-trap memory and laser-like focus later on. Our center instantly transforms from a fun zone to a quiet study room at a moment's notice.

NO VIDEO GAMES: Today's culture is inundated with electronic media. However, the time with us is best spent on other things. Should a student need something to do, learning chess and Korean language are options that are available inside our doors. 4. CULTURE: The school is run by the Choe family. From celebrations to language and customs, students are exposed to the Korean culture and experience. 5.

The first permanent building facilities were two wood-framed houses. As membership grew, plans were made to build a new, larger building, with the Whitehead Foundation largely supporting the initiative. In gratitude for the very generous gift from the Whitehead Foundation, the Club was named the Joseph B.
