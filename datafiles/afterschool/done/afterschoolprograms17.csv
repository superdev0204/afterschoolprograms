They can use the dedicated Art Studio to explore many mediums and styles or head out to the garden area to work on scientific investigations. When they are here the school agers enjoy time helping to take care of our colony of bunnies. We hope to add to the school agers growing abilities by offering them a chance to help out in the younger classrooms. They have the opportunity to read with younger children, solve problems with the younger classes, and even model appropriate classroom and playground behaviors. This not only gives the school ager a boost in self-esteem but it allows the younger children to see someone closer to their age achieve the praise of the teachers. During the warmer breaks the school age children can often be found taking walking field trips to the local parks, and mini golf courses. When appropriate we schedule to have science shows, musicians, or story tellers to come in to entertain and educate us. Our goal with the school age program is to create a safe, friendly, atmosphere in which the children can practice the skills they are learning during the school day as well as expand their horizons.

The CMC's Before and After School Programs meet the needs of all parents and children that want or need a safe, fun setting for their kids prior to, or after, school hours. For parents that need to drop their kids off early, The CMC's before school program opens its doors at 6:30 a.m. and keeps a watchful eye until whatever time their bus arrives to take them to school. For those that want or need their children supervised once classes get out, our After School program gets kids off the bus, supervises homework, offers arts and crafts, and of course lets them run, play, and burn off that extra energy until they get picked up. After that it's home for dinner and early to bed after a full day of activity! Our after school program runs from bus drop-off until 6:00 pm. Finally, when the need arises, our before & After School programs combined provide safe, reassuring care for parents that need extended help throughout the day. Children that are signed-up for our Before & After School program have a reserved place for supervised care on snow days, early dismissal, late openings, holidays and vacation days. We're always here to help. The Children’s Movement Center was founded on the belief that every child benefits from Active Play. Your child will get plenty of activity in our program. Different parts of the activity center are featured each day. If it’s nice out, we may start with a game of whiffle ball right off the bus, then get some homework done inside before playing on the surfer or the trampolines. We change things up each day to keep the kids interested and happy… and they always get excited for the zip line! Our teachers and staff have fun with the kids. They play tag, push swings, and climb the maze. The bottom line is our staff members enjoy their jobs and you’ll appreciate their help in improving the After School lives of your children. Come join in, you’ll love the results!";;"Before & After School Rates - Tuition: $125.00 per week (Includes holidays, early dismissal, vacation days, snow days); Before School Care - Tuition: $65.00 per week, For schools delays and closings the hourly rate will be applied in addition to your tuition; After School Care - Tuition: $80.00 per week.
