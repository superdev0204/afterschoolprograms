Supervised homework time and assistance is offered Monday through Thursday from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ""School's Out"" Days: On days on which regular classes are closed (conference days, professional days, spring break, selected holidays and snow days on which it's safe for our staff to travel to work), full-day child care is available in the same environments in which before- and after-school care is based.

Days however, are not one-dimensional and include exercise, structured games, and valuable down time for schoolwork, reading and other activities. Every day begins with us providing transportation from select area schools to our facility, and winds down with our conventional pick up times that are great for parents.

Utilizing the bays where the fire trucks once stood, the Club welcomed nearly 100 children in need of services, but quickly reached capacity. As Riviera Beach Elementary School was closing, the organization leased two of the buildings. The lease included the original schoolhouse built in 1927. This increased the facility to nearly 14,000 square feet, which enabled the organization to serve several hundred children on a daily basis. From 1993 to 2010, the Clubhouse served thousands of young people, but the school buildings lacked amenities and were slowly deteriorating due to age. Thanks to a generous gift from the Max M. & Marjorie S. Fisher Foundation, Lesly Smith, Danielle Hickox Moore and Siro and Roberta DeGasperis a new clubhouse opened on November 13, 2010.

In 1998, because of Sandy Abouzeid, the Club doubled its size, bringing it to 7,000 square feet. But even with the expansion, the club’s limited size still forced the club to turn away hundreds of children in need. Working in conjunction with the Village of Wellington, a new parcel in a high density area with a large youth expansion was acquired and a new lease was finalized. In 2012, thanks to a generous $1.5 million donation from Neil S. Hirsch, $600,000 from Palm Beach County, $700,000 from the Village of Wellington and numerous other donations, the organization broke ground for the new 22,570 square foot Neil S.

Fisher Boys & Girls Club officially opened its doors on November 5, 2011 and replaced the first clubhouse ever opened in Palm Beach County. The first Club was housed in what was originally a World War II Officers Club, pool and bathhouse. The facility was later purchased by the Knights of Columbus until 1969, when a group of civic and community leaders headed by then Palm Beach County Sheriff William Heightman approached the organization about selling it for a Boys Club. After a fundraising effort, the facility was purchased for $40,000 and opened in September, 1971 as the Boys Club of  the Palm Beaches. Over the years, a number of additions were added, including the August H. Oenbrink Memorial Gymnasium and the Charles A. Weber Teen Lounge. While girls were often welcome visitors, it was not until 1989 that the Club officially admitted girls as full members and changed its name to the Boys & Girls Club of West Palm Beach. Through the years, the neighborhood saw a transformation as less children populated the area and more commercial activities surrounded the Clubhouse. In 2008, Mrs. Marjorie S. Fisher, (hearing the Club was in need of an expansion and renovation), visited the Club and decided that not only was a renovation in order, but a new state-of-the-art facility. Thanks to a generous $2 million donation from Marjorie S, Fisher and the support of other generous donors such as Lesly S. Smith, the former Mayor of Palm Beach, and her daughter Danielle Hickox Moore, the dream of a new Club took shape. With little outdoor space, the existing location could not accommodate the plans for the new 22,000 square foot facility. Working with the Palm Beach County Commission, 11 acres of county land in a densely populated residential area with numerous schools in the immediate area was acquired. The new facility boasts a number of amenities such as a dance studio, music room, science lab, full gymnasium, teen, junior, and cadet games rooms, cafeteria, computer lab, arts & crafts center and learning center.";"Tutoring with certified teachers; Daily homework help; Smart Moves prevention curriculum; Arts & crafts; Singing classes; Cooking classes; Speaker series; Field Trips; Basketball; Daily inside and outside play; Computer education; Summer Camp; Spring/Winter break camps; Prevention programs; Leadership Programs";"$30 annual membership fee for school year; Affordable fees for extended programs (summer/spring/winter); Nominal fees for transportation; Scholarships available; No child is ever turned away due to an inability to pay a fee";"YES";"NO";;

As an alternative to traditional after school child care we offer an environment of fun, discipline building structured activities and education for your school aged child. Each day, Monday thru Friday our school van will pick your child up from school at dismissal time and transport them to our facility where they will have snack time, do homework, get some exercise, create projects, participate in group activities like Chinese language class, Martial Arts, Self-Defense, Art, Music and more.

We do not have you sign contracts! We have been providing this service for the past 17 years in the same area. We work with local Elementary Schools and will pick up your child everyday at dismissal. Rest assured that your child will be safe and cared for by Master Bobby Dixon, Sensei Erik Gianini, and staff. They are transported by Master Dixon and Sensei Gianini safely to the Dojo via Company owned passenger vans. The Karate school is located less than 3 miles from most Elementary schools we pick up from and in a few cases, less than 1 mile! Homework is the 1st priority when the students arrive. All students must start and finish all homework assignments. Once the homework is completed, (checked by a KARATE SCHOOL STAFF MEMBER FOR COMPLETION) and put anyway neatly, they may participate in class or play any number of games. Our programs are designed to learn Martial Arts and it’s tenants that we teach: EXERCISE, DISCIPLINE, RESPECT, MANNERS, SELF DEFENSE AND SELF ESTEEM. We accomplish this by testing students for Belt Rankings. WE DO NOT HAND OUT BELTS! THEY ARE EARNED! Students will test ONLY when they are ready to go to the next level and NOT because of a contracted time-line ( Remember that we do not require you to sign any contracts!) We have only the very best Instructors to teach your children. You are always welcome to come in and watch your child’s classes. We give out special awards for children that make the Honor Roll. We give out another award for straight “A’s”! We take their picture and Honor them by placing it on the “HONOR ROLL WALL“. And if that was not enough, we still give out another award for the student with the most improved grades in a marking period. Any and all awards earned will be given to the student in front of the whole student body with great applause. We are not a commercial school. We are a Family owned and operated Karate School that takes great pride in delivering quality instruction and results for all of our students. We do cap our after school enrollment program to 35 children. Enrollment does fill up quickly so don’t wait until the last minute to reverse your child’s membership in our programs. Each of our staff members are certified Black Belts. They have been specially trained to teach children. The owner and Head Instructor, Master Bobby Dixon, over sees all classes and the Instructors that teach them. If you have any questions, you are always welcome to come in and speak to any of our Instructors and as always, Master Dixon. We do have games as well as videos but students can only play during certain times providing their homework is completed and they give 100% effort in class. We are a Licensed Martial arts School and not a Daycare. Students may eat a snack before class which will be from 4:00 pm till 5:00 pm daily. You may pick up your child from 5:00 pm until 6:30 pm. The students, will need to come prepared each day to learn. We do require them to bring their uniform to class. They can pack them inside their school back packs. We also do require (when the student is ready) each student to have the proper protective training gear. This is a must!
