During these non-school hours, children have opportunities to choose a variety of enriching activities. Their choices allow them to explore new fields of interest and engage in hands-on activities within a supervised neighborhood setting.

The Thomas Lay After-School Program runs from 3-5:30pm Monday through Friday for elementary school and 4:30-5:30pm Monday through Thursday for middle school. We would love for mentors to come volunteer on any day of the week that works for them! A basic day at Thomas Lay consists of helping a child one-on-one with their homework and then reading with them for 20 minutes. After the child is done with their schoolwork, we encourage the mentors to interact with the kids by playing sports or doing crafts with them. The Thomas Lay After-School Program was established in the Spring of 2006, and since that time, the program has served elementary and middle school students in the Athens area. Every weekday during the academic year, UGA students provide individual tutoring and mentoring for local students. By providing homework help and extended learning activities, Thomas Lay creates an atmosphere that encourages enthusiastic learning and play. Housed at the Thomas N. Lay Park Community Center, the program serves about 40 elementary school students and 20 middle school students, and is supported by approximately 300 UGA volunteers every semester.";;;"YES";"NO";;
