Our BASICS program (Building Adaptable Skills and Increasing Capacity for Self-Sufficiency) provides a safe, structured after-school setting for youth aged 5 to 22 with physical and/or developmental disabilities where they can learn, grow and have fun. Our one-to-five staff to client ratio will give your family peace of mind of knowing that your precious family members have our full attention and focus as they enhance their social skills, develop independent living skills and improve academically within our after school program. To ensure a safe, stable environment, we do ask that all our students are able to participate in a group setting. If your child requires one-on-one assistance during school hours, the BASICS program is not a format that will meet your child’s needs. However, we will happily provide you with guidance and advice on available alternatives. BASICS takes the guesswork out of scheduling by following the Duval County Public Schools calendar. We are open Monday through Friday from 2:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m. On early release days, BASICS conveniently opens at 1:00 p.m. Because we understand how difficult it can be to arrange alternative care or take off from work when schools close, we offer workshops on most holidays and teacher planning days. We announce dates and details well in advance to assist with planning. Transportation to Hope Haven is provided for children and young adults attending the North Florida School and Mainspring Academy. Students who attend a Duval County Public School can ride the school bus to Hope Haven. We ask that parents arrange for public school bus transportation.";"Sports and Games; Creative Arts/Art Therapy; Homework/Academic Help; Nutrition Lessons; Computers; Music and Movement; Zumba/Yoga/Karate; Social Skills; Cooking; Job Skills; Independent Living Skills";;"YES";"NO";;
