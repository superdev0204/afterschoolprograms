Club members also participate in reading, cultural activities, field trips, and attend professional sporting events. Members are required to read a book each month and to prepare a book report on each book read. This practice has enabled members to increase their reading comprehension and vocabulary skills and assisted more than 70% of the Club members to achieve honor roll status. As a member of the national Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the Club promotes the health, education, social, vocational, and character development of its members. The principles of brotherhood, sisterhood, scholarship, perseverance, and uplift are encouraged as members strive to attain the highest standards of academic and social excellence in life. Approximately 300 members participate in the Club’s programs and activities throughout the year, which includes study hall, workshops, community forums, teen dances, and other special programs. Through the efforts of the Board of Directors, staff and contributions from the community, more than 500 youth have attended colleges and universities throughout the United States. 32 of the Club’s members have obtained their Ph.D.’s. Many of these young people may not have had the opportunity to obtain a higher education without the guidance and financial assistance of the Club.

In 1998, the Girls Club, previously a separate organization located in the building next door, joined the Boys club to create the Boys & Girls Club of El Sobrante we know today. The first building was a small building in the far corner of the Club's current location that was surrounded by a slot car track. In the early 70's the community decided it needed a bigger club and in 1972 they broke ground to build a new 10,000 sq. ft. structure that we still use today.  Parents and friends of the club built the building on nights and weekends until it was completed on September 30, 1978. Our goal is to continue to expand the quality after-school program we offer and to increase our capacity to serve youth. On average we work with over 1,700 children a year through our flag football, basketball, after-school, summer and community programs. We purposely keep dues low ($25 for the school year) so any boy or girl can afford to join, and if they cannot afford the dues we provide a scholarship program for them. Members participate in a variety of programs within the five core areas of Arts; Education & Career Development; Sports, Fitness & Recreation; Health & Life Skills; and Character & Leadership Development. We are affiliated with the Boys & Girls Club of America (BGCA). The programs that we run have been tested by over 4,000 clubs representing 4.1 million children and are proven to work. We serve children (ages 7-18) from West Contra Costa, including El Sobrante, and its surrounding cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, Crockett, and Rodeo. At the beginning of the school year, members set personal, school, and career goals, which are reviewed at the end of the school year.
