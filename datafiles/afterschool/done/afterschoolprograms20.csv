Since 1987, the ASP has been dedicated to providing a safe, caring, and creative program to enrich the lives of 60 children in kindergarten through fifth grade during their after-school hours. The program provides children with the opportunity to interact with adults and other children in a comfortable and loving atmosphere. Children of all races, religions, and ethnic backgrounds are encouraged to apply for enrollment. We take pride in the diverse group of students currently enrolled. Although the majority of the children attend the two neighborhood D.C. public schools, Lafayette Elementary and Murch Elementary, children from other public and private schools are welcome and, in fact, are already enrolled. The ASP staff members meet the students at Lafayette and walk them to CCPC. The church van is used by other ASP staff members to pick up the students at Murch and transport them to CCPC. The children who attend other schools arrive by transportation arranged by their parents. The After School Program is located on the third floor of the education building. Once the children arrive from their respective schools, they are divided by grades into three groups in three large classrooms, with a teacher and an assistant in each room, and are provided with an afternoon snack. Afterwards, they are able to choose between opportunities to play in the large enclosed play yard adjacent to the education wing or to express their creativity with Lego structures, block towers or towns, crafts from recyclables, or other artwork. Occasionally, the groups take field trips to nearby playgrounds. Homework time is set aside and monitored by the teachers and assistants in the classrooms so that help is available when needed. The hours of operation are 3 to 6:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Occasionally, because of severe weather or teachers’ meetings, the ASP opens at 8:00 a.m. and closes at 6:30 p.m. Also, when schools have to close at noon because of severe weather or meetings, the ASP staff will pick up the children at the two neighborhood schools and bring them back to CCPC until their parents come from work. The program is closed for federal holidays and when DC public schools are closed for snow days. The students in the After School Program perform community service projects during the year by making holiday cards for the residents of Ingleside, cleaning nearby streams of trash, or making Christmas stockings for the patients at Children’s Hospital. Many sign up to be pen pals with children in after school programs in other parts of the United States.";;"Monthly Tuition: 5 afternoons a week - $450; 3 afternoons a week $360; 2 afternoons a week - $310";"YES";"NO";;

The program is based in our proven Human Development System, which teaches individuals to use their own unique set of gifts, talents, and abilities to make positive choices and navigate through challenging circumstances. Each day, Apprentices (program participants) engage in homework help and academic enrichment, athletics, meditation, free play, activities based on the Human Development System, and our unique artistic process. They receive mentoring from our dedicated team of staff and volunteers while also having opportunities to mentor and lead younger Apprentices as they age through the program. We partner with local universities to provide both group and individual tutoring in math and literacy skills. We also offer a daily nutritious snack, and we frequently provide field trips, guest speakers, and exposure to a wide range of artistic styles - including music, dance, poetry, drawing, comics, photography, and storytelling. Through this holistic process, developed throughout our over 18 years of experience working in Washington, DC's Ward 7 community, young men feel consistent and unwavering love; they know that they are safe and secure; and they grow fully confident in expressing all aspects of their identity. This results in remarkable transformations, as our Apprentices learn to see themselves as Gentlemen, Scholars, Artists, and Athletes. Our program team members bring their unique talents and abilities to the development of our program and use the Life Pieces curriculum for teachable moments such as: How do your thoughts, words, and actions impact your every day life? What are your innate creative abilities (skills and talents that are unique to you), and how can you use them to reach your goals? How can you apply your values when making difficult decisions?";;;"YES";"NO";;

We start with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what’s important to them. Then, we look at the importance of team work and healthy relationships. And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world.

At the end of each three month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event. This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum.

Our after-school and summer programs are free of charge and have a proven track record of addressing risk behaviors and increasing protective factors among youth living in the Greater Wilmington area of New Castle County, Delaware. The overall focus of our programs can be summed up in one word: prevention. Since 1998, Duffy's Hope has served youth in our community and was recognized as a 501c3 nonprofit organization in 2002. In that time we have reached more than 4,500 at- risk and hard-to- reach youth though direct program and mentoring services. Our office is located in the Community Service Building at 100 W. 10 th Street, Suite #9 in Wilmington, Delaware, but the programs take place in the community where they are needed most. We use evidence-based programs that are designed to meet the needs of at-risk youth age 12-17, their families and their communities to promote well-rounded success. Duffy's Hope staff and mentors work with each young person to improve academic performance and attendance, increase community and pro-social involvement, provide positive peer relations, improve protective factors related to youth violence and suicide, decrease risk factors related to youth engagement in violence and suicide, and reduce youth involvement in maladaptive behaviors and criminal activity. Parental involvement is the key to our success and what makes Duffy's Hope's programs unique. We encourage family involvement in after school and summer prevention programs provided through Duffy's Hope and promotes parental involvement in school, sports, and community activities in which the youth is engaged. In addition, a parent advisory committee meets once a month. Parents are exposed to guest speakers that address relevant topics related to parenting and household management. Not only are the students impacted through the program, but the parents as well. We are proud to say that students who have successfully completed our programs have a plan for their future and a way to achieve it. This is a great accomplishment in a world where crime, violence, gangs, substance abuse, suicide, teen pregnancy and school dropout are some of the many issues young people face. Our programs focus on positive opportunities and experiences for youth to combat the risk factors they encounter every day. Duffy's Hope envisions a world where young adults take control of their lives by proactively seeking and rising to achievements beyond their perceived potential, so they can improve their – and their community's – quality of life.";;;"YES";"NO";"http://duffyshopeinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-logo.png";

Over a period of 10 weeks, girls in the 3rd through 5th grade participate in an after-school program like no other. Designed to allow every girl to recognize her inner strength, the Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms.

The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development.  Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age. They also develop important strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. We start with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what’s important to them. Then, we look at the importance of team work and healthy relationships. And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health.

And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world.

Meeting twice a week in small teams, Girls on the Run teaches life skills through dynamic, interactive lessons and running games. The season culminates with a Girls on the Run 5k running event which gives participants a sense of achievement and a framework for setting and achieving goals. Over a period of 10 weeks, girls in the 3rd through 5th grade participate in an after-school program like no other. Designed to allow every girl to recognize her inner strength, the Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms. Throughout the season, the girls make new friends, build their confidence and celebrate all that makes them unique. The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development.  Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age. They also develop important strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. We start with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what’s important to them. Then, we look at the importance of team work and healthy relationships. And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health. At the end of each three month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event. This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum. Completing the 5k gives the girls a tangible understanding of the confidence that comes through accomplishment as well as a framework for setting and achieving life goals.
