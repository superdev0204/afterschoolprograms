A young priest, Don Bosco, foresaw the unsettling influence that the industrial revolution was having on youth. He inaugurated a Society of Priests, Brothers and Sisters to work with children of the poor and laboring classes. Aware of the understanding and patience required with youth work, he chose as patron St. Francis de Sales, who was noted for having conquered a fiery temper to achieve a gentle character. That family name ""Sales"" gave title to the Salesians of St. John Bosco. The Salesian Boys' Club was established in San Francisco in 1918 by Fr. Oreste Trincheri. Father came to the North Beach area of San Francisco and found that its atmosphere spawned 60% of the city's delinquency. He realized that the volatile, creative Italian character of the boys that made up the area must have outlets for their energies. The Salesian Boys' Club was the answer.";;"Membership is just $10.00 a year";"YES";"NO";;

As an educator, Mr. Kumon realized that a strong foundation in the basics was needed for success in higher level math. With that in mind, Toru Kumon created a series of worksheets for his son to do after school. Through daily practice and a commitment to mastering each concept, his son was able to solve differential equations and integral calculus problems by the time he was in the sixth grade. Kumon Centers are independently owned and operated by the Instructors. After an extensive training period, Instructors become certified to teach the Kumon Method of learning.  The first Kumon Center in North America was opened in New York in 1974. Currently, there are more than 1,300 franchised Kumon Centers in the U.S. and Canada. Individualized instruction of each Kumon student advances according to individual ability rather than age or grade level. To accomplish this, the Kumon curriculum presents math and reading concepts in small increments, providing ample practice for each step. This method of individualized learning encourages independent learning, giving students the knowledge and skills to study on their own. Through repeated practice, students develop mastery of skills before moving on to a higher level of study. Since the goal of the Kumon Method is to make high school study easy, Kumon students are encouraged to reach an advanced level of study.";"Math Program, Reading Program";"The monthly tuition fee is $120 per subject.
