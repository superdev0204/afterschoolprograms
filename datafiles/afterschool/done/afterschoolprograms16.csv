Through the Middle School Program, OpenWorld Learning is excited to begin offering services to the often forgotten middle school student. The core of the program is divided into distinctive “Techno Tracks” designed to attract, engage and instruct the middle school student. Additionally, students explore career opportunities within their areas of interest. The Middle School Program teaches iconic computer programming in an open-ended approach, which supports the development of problem solving skills, project planning and management, as well as, meta-cognition through reflection and feedback. One of our main goals is to keep an inventive, hands-on learning approach to curriculum design and implementation, one that enables children to learn by building, imagining, playing, testing, and improving their inventions by sharing it with peers and teachers. OpenWorld Learning’s Middle School curriculum currently includes the following Techno Tracks: Robotics, Movie Making, Website Design, and Graphic Design.  Each track allows students the opportunity to engage with their peers while learning about innovative technologies they could possibly encounter in their future. Additionally, we are working with prominent universities and companies to implement a Career Exploration curriculum designed to give students the opportunity and guidance to look at a variety of careers that are available to them and the various skills and abilities one needs to work in those career fields.  Career Exploration days occur at least once per month and involve student research prior to or during the day’s activities.";;;"YES";"NO";"http://www.openworldlearning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cropped-OWL_NewWebHeader3.jpg";

We are a learning company, whose mission is to help children build strong and playful minds. We offer after-school classes and summer camps in which our students learn to program computers by creating their own video games, animated stories, and interactive art. Our students build creative projects in Scratch, an MIT-developed computer programming language for children. Scratch is accessible to six-year-olds, yet is used in computer science courses at Harvard and Berkeley. As students build Scratch projects, they learn to code, while still in elementary school - in a fun and engaging way that deepens their love for creativity and teamwork. Our students take delight in numerous experiments and discoveries and deepen their passion for creativity and invention. They learn computer programming, math, and logic skills - and they grow as artists and engineers. Our enrichment classes are social, playful, inventive, and fun. We provide after-school coding classes at twelve schools in Denver serving children in grades 1-5. Our coding classes are offered at three private schools (Colorado Academy, St. Mary’s Academy, and Stanley British Primary School), and at nine Denver Public Schools (Bill Roberts, Bromwell, Brown, C3, Carson, Cory, Polaris at Ebert, Steele, and University Park).";;;"YES";"NO";"http://www.myerslearning.com/images/header2.gif";

Many programs have expanded to include before school, vacations, and summer programs. Adams12 Five Star Schools implemented the childcare programs in the mid 1980's, as the District and the community saw the need for programs to be offered. The programs were set up geographically and offered to all students of Adams 12 Five Star Schools. The programs have grown and are now offered in nearly all of the District's elementary schools. The purpose of the BASE Programs is to provide safe, quality, affordable child care in the school setting; whereby each individual child is enriched with various experiences conducive to their academic, social, and physical development. These self supporting programs are offered to any child enrolled in an Adams 12 Five Star Elementary School. BASE staff at Tarver Elementary are dedicated to continuing the education process before and after the school day ends for your child.

The before and after school program provides quality care on scheduled school days, as well as during early release and assessment and professional development days for working families. We provide daily hands-on science and art experiences, homework help, and movement activities (soccer, jump rope, basketball). Kids’ Corner has a theme-based week comprised of choices that engage diverse age groups. Families rely on District 49 Kids’ Corner to provide a warm, safe, fun and quality before and after school program for their children, kindergarten to fifth grade. The program offers before and after school care in Springs Ranch Elementary School, Evans International Elementary School and Remington Elementary School. Kids’ Corner provides each student with a fun-filled environment that engages and challenges children. We offer your child the choice to participate in one or all of our daily activities, such as art, drama, science, sports, group activities and homework help. We provide a daily exploration curriculum to keep children engaged with opportunities that help them make healthy choices, interact with friends.
