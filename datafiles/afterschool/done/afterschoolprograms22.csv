Over a period of 10 weeks, girls in the 3rd through 5th grade participate in an after-school program like no other. Designed to allow every girl to recognize her inner strength, the Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms. Throughout the season, the girls make new friends, build their confidence and celebrate all that makes them unique. The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development.  Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age.  They also develop important strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. We start with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what’s important to them.  Then, we look at the importance of team work and healthy relationships.  And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health.  At the end of each three month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event.  This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum.

Designed to allow every girl to recognize her inner strength, the Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms. Throughout the season, the girls make new friends, build their confidence and celebrate all that makes them unique. The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development.  Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age.  They also develop important strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. We start with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what’s important to them.  Then, we look at the importance of team work and healthy relationships.  And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health.  At the end of each three month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event.  This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum.  Completing the 5k gives the girls a tangible understanding of the confidence that comes through accomplishment as well as a framework for setting and achieving life goals.  Crossing the finish line is a defining moment when the girls realize that even the seemingly impossible IS possible.";;;"YES";"NO";"http://www.gotrnefl.org/public/img/logo_girlsontherun.png";

Designed to allow every girl to recognize her inner strength, the Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms.

The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development.

We start with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what’s important to them.  Then, we look at the importance of team work and healthy relationships.  And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health.

Designed to allow every girl to recognize her inner strength, the Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms. Throughout the season, the girls make new friends, build their confidence and celebrate all that makes them unique. The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development.  Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age.  They also develop important strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. We start with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what’s important to them.  Then, we look at the importance of team work and healthy relationships.  And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health.  At the end of each three month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event.  This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum.  Completing the 5k gives the girls a tangible understanding of the confidence that comes through accomplishment as well as a framework for setting and achieving life goals.  Crossing the finish line is a defining moment when the girls realize that even the seemingly impossible IS possible.";;;"YES";"NO";;

Over a period of 10 weeks, girls in the 3rd through 5th grade participate in an after-school program like no other. Designed to allow every girl to recognize her inner strength, the Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms. Throughout the season, the girls make new friends, build their confidence and celebrate all that makes them unique. The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development.  Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age.  They also develop important strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. We start with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what’s important to them.  Then, we look at the importance of team work and healthy relationships.  And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health.  At the end of each three month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event.  This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum.

Like Girls on the Run, the Girls on Track curriculum is delivered over the course of 10 to 12 weeks and addresses the societal, mental and emotional challenges particular to their age. Like the Girls on the Run curricula, we begin by encouraging the girls to examine and better understand who they are and what's important to them. Once they have a deeper awareness of their individual values, we look at the role of teams and healthy relationships. Lastly, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world.

At the end of each season, the girls and their running buddies complete a 5k running event which gives the girls a tangible sense of achievement as well as a framework for setting and achieving life goals.

Over a period of 12 weeks, girls in the 3rd through 5th grade participate in an after-school program like no other. Designed to allow every girl to recognize her inner strength, the Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms. Throughout the season, the girls make new friends, build their confidence and celebrate all that makes them unique. The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development. Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age. They also develop important strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. We start with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what’s important to them. Then, we look at the importance of team work and healthy relationships. And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health. At the end of each three month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event. This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum. Completing the 5k gives the girls a tangible understanding of the confidence that comes through accomplishment as well as a framework for setting and achieving life goals. Crossing the finish line is a defining moment when the girls realize that even the seemingly impossible IS possible.";;;"YES";"NO";;

Girls on the Run® is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to creating a world where every girl knows and activates her limitless potential and is free to boldly pursue her dreams. Over a period of 12 weeks, girls in the 3rd through 5th grade participate in an after-school program like no other. Designed to allow every girl to recognize her inner strength, the Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms. Throughout the season, the girls make new friends, build their confidence and celebrate all that makes them unique. The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development.  Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age. They also develop important strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. We start with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what’s important to them. Then, we look at the importance of team work and healthy relationships. And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health.  At the end of each three month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event.  This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum. Completing the 5k gives the girls a tangible understanding of the confidence that comes through accomplishment as well as a framework for setting and achieving life goals. Crossing the finish line is a defining moment when the girls realize that even the seemingly impossible IS possible.";;;"YES";"NO";"http://www.gotrbigbend.org/public/img/logo_girlsontherun.png";

The 24-lesson curriculum is taught by certified Girls on the Run coaches and includes three parts: understanding ourselves, valuing relationships and teamwork and understanding how we connect with and shape the world at large. Running is used to inspire and motivate girls, encourage lifelong health and fitness, and build confidence through accomplishment. At each season's conclusion, the girls and their running buddies complete a 5k running event.

Although Mr. Gabb retired from teaching in 2014, his dedication to education lives on through GASP, where life skills and good study habits are a focus. In Mr. Gabb's stead, Shelby Stocker has taken over the program after 5 years working and learning from the founder, as well as the children themselves. A recent University of Florida graduate, Shelby hopes to employ skills learned throughout her collegiate studies to take the program above and beyond it's original grandeur. GASP is committed to employing staffers who model character and integrity. They assist with everything from tying shoes, to conflict resolution, to working through those tough math problems. The staffers are the heart and soul of this program. During the academic year, the GASP schedule includes half an hour of dedicated homework time. Additionally, at your request, we can also ensure your child's homework is complete - and even checked by a staff member - before you pick them up. Think academics end with the school year? Not at GASP. Summer camp mornings are dedicated to academic instruction and review provided by certified elementary school teachers. GASP's goal is to help keep those young minds fresh and support their success in the coming year.

Emotionally we give them self confidence, self esteem, and a sense of self worth to help them make sound, positive decisions wherever they may go or wherever they may be. This is the critical aspect in teaching children these fundamental skills which prevents them from becoming the victim of bullying. American TKA owner, Master Ginarte speaks to school teachers on a weekly basis, attends conferences & reviews each students reports cards quarterly to monitor students progression. Master Ginarte created our “Triangle Principle” which focuses on all 3 points converging together for the child’s success, (Home, School & Martial Arts). This is used in every aspect of our program. Our program includes 7 forms of Martial Arts, (Tae Kwon Do, MMA, Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Boxing, Capoeira & Parkour.

As an added convenience we offer full day programs on teacher workdays, school half days and most holidays. Students will enjoy fun days with diverse activities in addition to their martial arts training. We may visit local parks and area attractions or perhaps invite a guest speaker or performer. Of course our facilities offer plenty of opportunities for fun too. Maybe a kid’s movie, state of the art entertainment systems or an exciting day participating in Indoor Olympic Games. Whether students are enjoying a day of indoor soccer or watching an exciting movie, you can be sure your child will have a great time with the varied activities.";;;"YES";"NO";"http://americantka.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/A+KarateAfterSchool640.png";

Our after school program will teach your child: Respect, Self-Control, Self-Discipline,  Focus/Concentration, Self-Protection, Problem Solving, Goal Setting... and MORE!!! Our after school programs are perfect for children of DeLand, DeBary, Deltona, and Orange City. We are not a licensed child care facility. Instead, we are a licensed martial arts school providing a constructive alternative to traditional daycare. Each afternoon program is planned with a variety of structured group activities such as karate and tumbling classes, life and safety skill lessons, fitness and flexibility training as well as organized fun time to encourage healthy socialization skills. And best yet, it's convenient and affordable since it combines after school care with karate training for less than the price of both, and you don't have to rush from work to get your kids to classes.
