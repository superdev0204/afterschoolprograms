High School Extended Learning: High schools across the county are struggling to properly prepare students for college and the workforce.  We believe it is imperative for communities to partner with schools to provide additional supports. Using evidence-based practices, the THINK Together for Teens (T3) high school program is designed to respond to the unique needs and strengths identified by students, teachers and administrators. Our overall goal is to support college and career-ready students by helping them meet state standards in core academic subjects, meet all graduation requirements, and expose them to relevant 21st Century Learning Skills.  Although the activities schedule varies by school, all T3 programs incorporate academic and enrichment components, a nutritional snack and opportunities for traditional and non-traditional physical activities including intramural sports and dance, and utilize school fitness centers and weightlifting facilities. THINK Together forged a new partnership in 2010-11 with the j.k. livin foundation.

Since its inception in 1994, THINK (Teaching, Helping, Inspiring and Nurturing Kids) Together has been committed to improving academic outcomes for children and youth living in under-resourced communities. THINK Together’s daily middle school program consists of academic and enrichment elements and a healthy living component that includes physical fitness, character education and nutrition education. The program is open to 6th through 8th grade students from the time the school day ends to 6 pm (approximately 20-22 hours a week). Students receive a healthy snack before participating in a rotation of structured activities. We use strategies rooted in the core elementary school curricula but augmented with more choice and enrichment activities. The resulting program has a “club” feeling that is engaging to young adolescents while still boosting academic achievement.  THINK Together staff emphasize the three Rs of Afterschool:  Relationships, Relevance, and Rigor by embedding them into club activities.  Middle school students work more effectively in small groups if they can see the connection between the activity and the real world that they live in, and if the activities are challenging enough to reduce boredom and easy enough to develop a sense of self-efficacy.";;;"YES";"NO";"http://www.thinktogether.org/wp-content/themes/u-design5.2/styles/new_page-images/logo.png";

THINK Together staff emphasize the three Rs of Afterschool:  Relationships, Relevance, and Rigor by embedding them into club activities.  Middle school students work more effectively in small groups if they can see the connection between the activity and the real world that they live in, and if the activities are challenging enough to reduce boredom and easy enough to develop a sense of self-efficacy.";;;"YES";"NO";"http://www.thinktogether.org/wp-content/themes/u-design5.2/styles/new_page-images/logo.png";

Since its inception in 1994, THINK (Teaching, Helping, Inspiring and Nurturing Kids) Together has been committed to improving academic outcomes for children and youth living in under-resourced communities. Elementary Extended Learning: THINK Together’s daily comprehensive elementary school programs consist of academic and enrichment elements and a healthy living component that includes physical fitness, character education and nutrition education. The program is open to Kindergarten through 6th grade students from the time the school day ends to 6 pm (approximately 20-22 hours a week). Students receive a healthy snack before participating in a rotation of structured activities. THINK Together’s standards-based curriculum intentionally aligns with core day instruction and extends learning time in a safe, adult-supervised environment.  The enrichment component helps students close the achievement gap with a broad array of disguised learning activities driven by student interest and staff talents. Examples include journalism, cheerleading, science fair preparation, skateboarding, cooking, crafts, robotics, and graphic design.  The development of 21st Century Learning Skills, such as critical thinking, problem solving through inquiry, creativity, entrepreneurial skills, communication, collaboration, social responsibility and leadership is embedded within project-based learning activities in our programs. A typical THINK Together elementary school site serves between 90 and 200 students each school day. Each site is staffed by Program Leaders in order to maintain a student to paid staff ratio of no more than 20:1. Program Leaders work alongside community volunteers and are supervised by one full-time Site Coordinator, who works closely with the school principal and teachers to align the content of the afterschool program with school-day needs and priorities. Site Coordinators receive training and side-by-side coaching from experienced Quality Assurance Coaches to ensure the highest program quality.";"Homework Assistance, Language Skills, Academic Achievement for English Learners, Mathematics, STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) Education, Enrichment, Healthy Living";;"YES";"NO";"http://www.thinktogether.org/wp-content/themes/u-design5.2/styles/new_page-images/logo.png";
