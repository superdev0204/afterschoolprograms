The hours after school should be a time to promote developmentally appropriate skill building and give children the opportunity to explore their interests and reflect on their day. We are committed to the development of caring and supportive relationships between children and adults and will provide opportunities for children to learn 21st century skills such as leadership, teamwork, conflict resolution, and community engagement. Our unique curriculum will help to facilitate the growth of children’s self-confidence, motivation, and socialization. We understand that children’s needs change as they grow and that their interactions with their teachers - and with one another - differ qualitatively at each stage. We believe that children are individuals and that our responses to them must not be reflexive or prescribed, but must be tailored to a child’s own temperament. To these ends, we have planned a program which exercises a child’s body, mind, and spirit; which balances structured interaction with free play; giving children the freedom to choose what interests them and learn from and build upon those interests. The Rectory School - After School Program has created a curriculum that tailors itself to the children’s interests. With three divisions of curriculum; FOCUS, S.A.N.D, and ADVENTURE, children will have opportunities to experience nature, art, science, sports, hiking, cooperative games, book club, creating and performing a play, and to also have free time to do homework or just talk with friends.";"n/a";"After Hours: 3:00pm - 5:30pm $15.00/day; Extended Hours: 5:30pm - 6:00pm $3/day ";"YES";"NO";;

You can sign up your children for homework time where we have college student tutors available to get your child started with their homework for the day. We receive children early on Middletown Public School early dismissal days and work with Wesleyan staff and students to provide additional hands-on activities during that time when possible.
