And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health.  At the end of each three month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event.  This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum.

In all of our activities, we teach manners, cooperation, and character development. During the summer, when over 85% of our students have no other activities in which to participate, we provide extra programming, creating opportunities to keep our students’ minds sharp and their time productively occupied.

Students are also motivated by earning points for their academic achievement and for arriving on time. With their points, they can buy prizes ranging from basic school supplies to a new bike. Students who save their points instead of buying a prize are rewarded with interest points, teaching them the value of saving and resisting immediate gratification.Our staff and volunteers strive to work with parents and teachers of the children to meet their educational and behavioral needs.

In addition to academic work, students enjoy enrichment programs led by people from the community who teach art, healthy eating, public speaking, career exploration, and many other topics.

They needed the opportunities that only a Boys & Girls Club could provide and in April 2003, the Harlan County Boys and Girls Club opened its first dedicated youth facility- The Cawood Ledford Boys & Girls Club- located at the former Loyall Elementary School.  In January 2005, the Club moved into a storefront facility in downtown Harlan and launched a massive capital campaign to raise funds to build a new facility. Led by architect Dwyne Wilkerson and trustees Rick Fox and Don Parsons, construction began on a new, permanent facility in June 2006. In August 2007, the newly constructed Cawood Ledford facility opened in the Fairview section of Harlan.  Named for Kentucky's legendary sports announcer, the Cawood Ledford Club is tailor-made for our members and offers a large game room, an arts and crafts room, a technology lab, a fitness room, an education lab, kitchen and administrative offices.
