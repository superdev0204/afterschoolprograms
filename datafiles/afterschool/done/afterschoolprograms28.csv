And, finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into our program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health.  At the end of each three-month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event. This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum.  Completing the 5k gives the girls a tangible understanding of the confidence that comes through accomplishment as well as a framework for setting and achieving life goals.

We are open at 7 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. Even though we are open for 11 hours, a child can be here no more than 10 hours. Parents must bring their child to the school age room, regardless of age. Our staff keep a similar work schedule all year long, they know the children need consistency where they are cared for. We do have a list of subs for our staff, and they are considered apart of the AGC team as well. Nutritious snacks are provided at AGC, once before school and again after school. The snacks meet the nutritional guidelines set by the state and contain foods from at least two of the food groups and/or skim, 1% milk or %100 juice.  A weekly schedule is posted for parents to see. A prayer will be said before each meal thanking God for His provisions.  On a child's birthday, they may choose to provide snack for their friends at childcare and it does not need to follow DHS guidelines but does need to be prepackaged. The transportation between the school and the Shueyville United Methodist church is provided by College Community School District (CCSD) in Cedar Rapids. Staff will call parents if their child did not make it off the bus unless parents previously notified AGC. To help enhance social skills, AGC utilizes PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports).
