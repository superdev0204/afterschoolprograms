In 1990, the organization was renamed The Boys & Girls Club of America to reflect the Club’s commitment to serving all young persons. Since 1987, the Boys & Girls Club of America has founded more than 4,000 new locations nationwide. The Huntington County Boys and Girls Club was proposed in the late 1990’s by the Chief Probation Officer along with the Juvenile Judge as a response to then increasing juvenile presence in the judicial system. The need was evident for the community to develop year round programs for children that addressed the physical, emotional and educational needs of its members, as well as working in conjunction with other area programs. The Boys and Girls Club of Huntington County, Inc. was incorporated in 1998. The club began serving the youth of the Huntington Community in February 2001.";;;"YES";"NO";"https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/1620f700/dms3rep/multi/desktop/PARKVIEW-04%20WHITE_iqW1Oi9NSGuzT6KS7Of6-1402x400.png";

On August 13, 1968, ground was broken for a new building, located where Smith Office Supply now resides. In 1988, the Boys Club proudly expanded its reach and opened its doors to include all youth, as the Montgomery County Boys & Girls Club. In the fall of 2000, after the citizens of Montgomery County raised upwards of $2.5 million dollars in 8 short months, new ground was broken for the construction of what is now home to the Boys & Girls Club. The first children were served in the new building in the fall of 2000. Without the support of the Montgomery County citizens and community at large, none of this would have been possible! Through the combination of our after school sports and community programs, we continue to serve an average of 2,500 Montgomery County youth per year. In order to make this a reality, we rely on continued support from the community in the form of volunteerism, local partnerships, & agency support from MUFFY and the Montgomery County Community Foundation (MCCF).";;"Annual Membership: $30.00 a year/per child or $75.00 for families with 3 or more children; Athletic Membership: $10.00/sport...renewable at the beginning of each sports; After School Program: $30.00 a year/per child, or $75.00 for families with 3 or more children; Summer Kidstop Program: $15.00 per child to register";"YES";"NO";"http://bgcmontgomery.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Logo_Small.png";

We are also the first site in Grant County to become a policy host for domestic violence prevention. Our ultimate desire at the Boys and Girls Club of Grant County is to meet our mission in inspiring and enabling every member to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring citizens. Our programs are tested and proved to be successful. Some recent data provided through our NYO Initiative state that 85% learned right from wrong, 85% found a sense of belonging, 60% said the Club was the only place to go in their neighborhood after school, and 90% said the Club was one of the best things available to them in their community. These statistics paint the picture that is the Boys and Girls Club: a safe and positive place for kids to grow and learn. Those provide information on current Club kids, but our alumni are still affected by their years spent with us. 57% of our alumni said the Club saved their life and 91% are satisfied with their adult life. We take our years with them as youth to provide them a bright and stable future that then allows them to give back to the community that raised them. We are continuing into our 54th year of service with growing ADA, increased mentoring sign-ups, successful athletic leagues, and a thriving educational program. We are able to open our doors, feed our meals, and be a safe and positive place for our youth. Our need is now sustainability in our attendance, continuing to help families and youth who need guidance, and finding more mentors to help Grant County’s youth. With more resources, we will be able to increase our recruiting of volunteers, maintain higher staff numbers, and maintain the positive impact our mentors have in Marion, Indiana and surrounding Grant County communities.";;;"YES";"NO";"http://bgcgrantcounty.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Logo-278-100.png";
