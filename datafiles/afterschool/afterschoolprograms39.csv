The Therapeutic After-School/Summer Enrichment Program is designed for at-risk children ages 5 to 12. The program provides children the opportunity to participate in lots of activities – art therapy, recreation (swimming and games) and vocational/work training. Licensed Clinical Therapist provide individual, family and group counseling. Children or students can work on their mental health and behavior problems. They receive guidance on handling interactions at home and school. Families are invited to attend social events and to participate in planning meetings with the treatment team. These programs have helped so many children or students with problem behaviors. Through counseling sessions, the children or students work on communication skills. The parents work on their parenting skills. Children or students also get individual counseling to help their interactions with family members. With these programs, children or students get the individual attention they need to get on track. They gain self-esteem, self-confidence and a sense of security. Many of these children have experienced trauma in their lives – family violence, or homelessness. The trauma affects their social, emotional, cognitive, and physiological development. They have difficulty trusting others, and have trouble functioning at school. They have trouble with relationships. In the program, healing begins by creating a trusting environment where the children feel safe to talk about their vulnerabilities. The professional staff guides every child to increase their coping strategies, improve parent-child relationships, and increase children’s resiliency and self-esteem. Fun is a critical part of the program. Fun-filled field trips and experiences help the children or students get away from their problems and enjoy life.";;;"YES";"NO";;
