                    <div class="job-description-content">
                        <p>Head Start is a Federal program for preschool children from low-income families. The Head Start
                            program is operated by local non-profit organizations in almost every county in the country.
                            Children who attend Head Start participate in a variety of educational activities. They also
                            receive free medical and dental care, have healthy meals and snacks, and enjoy playing indoors
                            and outdoors in a safe setting.</p>
                        <p>Head Start helps all children succeed. Services are offered to meet the special needs of children
                            with disabilities. Most children in Head Start are between the ages of 3 and 5 years old.
                            Services are also available to infants and toddlers in selected sites. </p>

                    <div class="job-description-content">
                        <p>Head Start is a program that helps young children between the ages of three and five grow up
                            ready to succeed in school and in life. Programs work to meet high standards for delivering
                            quality services to children and their families. Children who attend Head Start programs
                            participate in fun activities while developing social skills. Head Start children also receive
                            nutritious meals and the necessary health care in a safe environment.</p>
                        <p>Early Head Start is a program for families with infants and toddlers ages birth to three.
                            Families who are expecting a new baby may enroll in Early Head Start. Families do not pay a fee
                            for Head Start or Early Head Start.</p>
                        <p>Parents with children in Head Start participate in all aspects of the program. They help to
                            govern, plan what children learn, and provide advice about needed services. Parents and other
                            community members also volunteer in classrooms and other parts of the programs.</p>
                        <p>Head Start and Early Head Start welcome children with disabilities. Parents of children with
                            disabilities are strongly encouraged to participate in their childrenâ€™s daily routines and
                            activities.</p>

                    <div class="job-description-title">Is My Child Eligible for Head Start or Early Head Start?</div>
                    <div class="job-description-content">
                        <p>Children from birth to age five from families with low income, according to the Poverty
                            Guidelines published by the federal government, are eligible for Head Start and Early Head Start
                            services.</p>
                        <p>Children in foster care, homeless children, and children from families receiving public
                            assistance (TANF or SSI) are categorically eligible for Head Start and Early Head Start services
                            regardless of income.</p>
                        <p>Head Start programs may enroll up to 10% of children from families that have incomes above the
                            Poverty Guidelines. Programs may also serve up to an additional 35% of children from families
                            whose incomes are above the Poverty Guidelines, but below 130% of the poverty line if the
                            program can ensure that certain conditions have been met.</p>
                        <p>Pregnant women may also be eligible for Early Head Start.</p>

                    <div class="job-description-title">What would be your child's routine in a Head Start program?</div>
                    <div class="job-description-content">
                        <p>Most children who enroll in Head Start attend a half-day center-based program. However, some
                            communities may operate a full-day program or provide Head Start services through a home-based
                            setting. In a home-based program, staff called Home Visitors teach parents how to provide
                            learning experiences for their own children.</p>
                        <p>Some center-based programs offer children bus rides to and from home.</p>
                        <p>When the children arrive at the center, they are greeted warmly by their teachers. They put
                            whatever they have brought from home in a place which is their own to use every day.</p>
                        <p>Classroom time includes many different activities. Some teachers begin the day by asking the
                            children to sit in a circle. This encourages the children to talk about an idea or experience
                            they want to share with others. In some centers, the children plan their activities. They may
                            choose among art, playing with blocks or table toys, science activities, dancing to music,
                            looking at books, or pretend housekeeping. Children can switch activities if they prefer another
                            challenge.</p>
                        <p>Each day, they have time to work in a small group with other children and to play outdoors on
                            safe playground equipment.</p>
                        <p>At lunchtime, children receive a nutritious meal and brush their teeth. All the children are
                            taught to wash their hands before meals, and are encouraged to develop good personal and health
                            habits. If they come for an afternoon session, they also receive a healthy snack.</p>
